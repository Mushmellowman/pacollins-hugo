# About

This is a simple spreadsheet (originally Microsoft Excel; converted to Google Sheets)
that Georgia high school students can use to track their HOPE GPA (4-point scale
with a half quality point for Advanced Placement (AP) classes) and their School
GPA (5-point scale).

# Usage

**Click** `File -> Make A Copy...` to create a copy on your personal Google Drive,
or **Click** `File -> Download as -> Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)` *or*
`File -> Download as -> OpenDocument Format (.ods)` to download it to your computer.

From here, simply enter your grade on a 4-point scale into the `Grade` column
and then notate `Y` or `N` into the `AP?` column. The calculator will then do
the rest.
